Notables
 - Instance variables in classes need to be protected (instead of private) to be accessed by subclasses.
 - The keyword extends allows for a subclass to inherit the methods and protected variables of the superclass.
 - The variables in the subclasses don't need to be created again (int _defense;), they already exist in the superclass, and can be re-intialized with a constructor.
