- Cleric: Has higher defense and attack stats, but reduced hitpoints and moderate strength.
- Wizard: Has a high strength stat, a reduced hitpoint stat, and moderate defense and attack.

- Ogre: Has a high attack stat, a reduced defense stat, and moderate hitpoints and strength.  

**Version to Version Modifications:**
- v0: YoRPG skeleton and creation of classes for Monster and Protagonist. 
- v1: Running YoRPG, finding errors, and invoking methods where needed be.
- v2: Created character classe and wrote some functions for the it and we used Mr. Mykolyk's care package to assist us. 
- v3: We added some of the Character and Monster classes, although we encountered some errors along the way. 
- v4: We solved the errors that we had gotten in the Character and Monster classes, added character and monster classes, and the about sections for the different   characters. 
- v5: Final changes, made the game completely playable. Fixed errors with "pat" inheriting other subclasses.

Ways In Which We Would Like To Grow The Game:
- It would be cool to add other features of RPGs, such as a shop or a currency, or some sort of larger storyline. Alas we have no time for that
