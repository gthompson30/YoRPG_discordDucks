# YoRPG_discordDucks
Our "YoRPG" project for APCS with Mr. Mykolyk

Team discordDucks: Kartik Vanjani, Gabriel Thompson, Marcus Wu, Iggy, Krrish, Nat


**Our New Classes:**
- Characters: Paladin, Cleric, Wizard
- Monsters: Ogre, Goblin, Leviathan

**Explanation Of New Classes:**

*Characters:*
- Paladin: Has a high hitpoint stat, a reduced strength stat, and moderate defense and attack.
- Cleric: Has higher defense and attack stats, but reduced hitpoints and moderate strength.
- Wizard: Has a high strength stat, a reduced hitpoint stat, and moderate defense and attack.

*Monsters:*
- Goblin: Has a high defense stat, but reduced hitpoints.
- Leviathan: Has high hitpoint and attack stats, with reduced defense.
- Ogre: Has a high attack stat, a reduced defense stat, and moderate hitpoints and strength.  

**Version to Version Modifications:**
- v0: YoRPG skeleton and creation of classes for Monster and Protagonist. 
- v1: Running YoRPG, finding errors, and invoking methods where needed be.
- v2: Created character classe and wrote some functions for the it and we used Mr. Mykolyk's care package to assist us. 
- v3: We added some of the Character and Monster classes, although we encountered some errors along the way. 
- v4: We solved the errors that we had gotten in the Character and Monster classes, added character and monster classes, and the about sections for the different   characters. 
- v5: Final changes, made the game completely playable. Fixed errors with "pat" inheriting other subclasses.

**Ways In Which We Would Like To Grow The Game:**
- It would be cool to add other features of RPGs, such as a shop or a currency, or some sort of larger storyline. Alas we have no time for that
