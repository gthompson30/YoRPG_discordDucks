# YoRPG_discordDucks
Our "YoRPG" project for APCS with Mr. Mykolyk

Team discordDucks: Kartik Vanjani, Gabriel Thompson, Marcus Wu, Iggy, Krrish, Nat


Our New Classes: 
- Characters: Paladin, Cleric, Wizard
- Monsters: Ogre, Goblin, Leviathan

Explanation Of New Classes:

Version to Version Modifications:
- v0: YoRPG skeleton and creation of classes for Monster and Protagonist. 
- v1: Running YoRPG, finding errors, and invoking methods where needed be.
- v2: Created character classe and wrote some functions for the it and we used Mr. Mykolyk's care package to assist us. 
- v3: We added some of the Character and Monster classes, although we encountered some errors along the way. 
- v4: We solved the errors that we had gotten in the Character and Monster classes, added character and monster classes, and the about sections for the different   characters. 

Ways In Which We Would Like To Grow The Game: 
- The main file does not really run the game as a whole. The necessary parts are there to make the game run, we just need to incorporate all the parts together.
